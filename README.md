## Usage

Note: The basic solver.py used brute force, it might cost a loooots of time to run a complex example with huge variables.
If u want to try all the test cases, just run 
```shell
python runAll.py solver.py [optional_directory_path]
```
This command will test all the cnf files in the target path (default by the current folder)

if u want to test with a single file, run
```shell
python solver.py your_file.cnf
```
